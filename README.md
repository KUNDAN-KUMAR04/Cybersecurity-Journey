üõ°Ô∏è Kundan Kumar's Cybersecurity Journey

Hi! I'm Kundan Kumar, a **B.Tech graduate with a specialization in Cybersecurity**. While I have a strong academic foundation, this repository is where I'll **document my hands-on learning path**, showcasing my practical skill development, projects, and growing expertise in the field.

## üìÖ Weekly Progress

Each week, I'll update:

* **‚úÖ TryHackMe Rooms Completed:** Listing specific rooms and the key takeaways/vulnerabilities explored (e.g., "Basic Pentesting," "Network Services," "Web Hacking Fundamentals").
* **üß™ Tools I Explore:** Deep diving into tools like:
    * **Nmap:** Network scanning and discovery (e.g., "Learned different scan types like SYN, UDP, and how to identify open ports").
    * **Wireshark:** Packet analysis and network traffic inspection (e.g., "Analyzed HTTP traffic, identified suspicious patterns, and filtered protocols").
    * **Metasploit Framework:** Exploitation and penetration testing (e.g., "Practiced exploiting vulnerable services and understanding payloads").
    * **Kali Linux:** Hands-on experience with this penetration testing distribution.
    * **John the Ripper/Hashcat:** Password cracking techniques.
    * **Burp Suite:** Web application vulnerability testing (e.g., "Explored proxies, repeaters, and basic web vulnerabilities like XSS/SQLi").
* **üß† Reinforcing Core Concepts & Practical Application:**
    * **Linux Fundamentals:** Advanced command-line proficiency, scripting for automation, system hardening.
    * **Networking Concepts:** Deep dive into protocols, network architectures, and security controls (firewalls, IDS/IPS).
    * **Security Principles:** Applying the CIA Triad, risk management, incident response frameworks (NIST, MITRE ATT&CK).
* **üìù Weekly Reflections and Plans:** What I learned, what challenged me, and what I plan to focus on next. This will include specific topics like "Understanding common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)" or "Exploring different types of malware."
* **üöß Mini-Projects/CTF Writeups:** Short writeups or code snippets for small challenges or concepts implemented (e.g., a simple Python script for port scanning, or a basic encryption/decryption tool).

## üìö Platforms I'm Learning From

* **TryHackMe:** For practical, guided labs and challenges to apply theoretical knowledge.
* **Linux Journey:** Solidifying my Linux command-line skills for security operations.
* **Google Cybersecurity Course:** Reinforcing foundational understanding and exploring new perspectives.
* **Hack The Box / VulnHub:** (Future exploration) For more advanced, realistic CTF environments and penetration testing scenarios.
* **OWASP Top 10:** Deep diving into the most critical web application security risks.
* **PortSwigger Web Security Academy:** Hands-on learning for web vulnerability exploitation.

## üìå Goals

* **Solidify Practical Cybersecurity Skills:** Translate academic knowledge into hands-on proficiency across various domains.
* **Complete 20+ TryHackMe Rooms:** Focusing on a diverse range of topics from network security to web application vulnerabilities, aiming for specialized paths.
* **Deepen Expertise in Key Cybersecurity Domains:** Gain in-depth practical exposure to areas like:
    * **Network Security:** Implementing and analyzing firewalls, IDS/IPS, VPNs, and network segmentation.
    * **Web Application Security:** Advanced vulnerability analysis (SQLi, XSS, CSRF), secure coding practices, and API security.
    * **Endpoint Security:** Implementing and managing EDR solutions, host-based intrusion detection, and system hardening.
    * **Cloud Security (Basic to Intermediate):** Understanding and securing common cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP).
    * **Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR):** Hands-on experience with forensic tools and simulating incident handling steps.
* **Develop Proficiency with Industry-Standard Tools:** Become highly skilled in using Nmap, Wireshark, Metasploit, Burp Suite, and various scripting languages (Python, Bash) for automation and analysis.
* **Participate Actively in CTFs and Security Challenges:** Apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios, document solutions, and learn from community write-ups.
* **Pursue Entry-Level Certifications:** Prepare for and obtain certifications like CompTIA Security+, Network+, or industry-recognized vendor-specific certs to validate practical skills.
* **Apply for a SOC Analyst or Cybersecurity Internship/Entry-Level Role:** Leverage learned skills, project experience, and documented progress to secure my first role in the cybersecurity industry.

Stay tuned üëÄ ‚Äî I'm continuously building and refining my skills in this dynamic field!
